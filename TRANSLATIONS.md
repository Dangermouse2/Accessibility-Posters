We want these posters to be available in as many languages as possible. You are welcome to translate the posters.

We only ask you to make available publicly.

**Help**
The posters use [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/). If you don't have it in your computer, you will need to:

1. Download [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/). There is a big "Download" button on the homepage
2. Uncompress the downloaded .zip file. Out comes a directory called <code>font-awesome-version_number</code>
3. Inside that directory, find the <code>fonts/fontawesome-webfont.ttf</code> file
4. Copy that file and paste it in your system's fonts directory

Once you have [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/), here is a possible way to translate the posters:

1. [clone the repository](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters)
2. translate them
3. Add 2 or 3 letter language code to the end of each poster - e.g. "screenreader_fr.pdf."
4. send a pull request so we can merge them, or tell us where they are so we can advertise them here.

If you have any questions, just ask!
