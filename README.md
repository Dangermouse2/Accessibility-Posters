# Access Needs Posters
Home Office Digital repository of posters covering different topics - research, access needs, accessibility, design.

**Background**

If you'd like to learn more about these posters, and why they were made, read [this blogpost by their creator Karwai Pun](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/).


**Contributions**

If you've got a poster you've created, and would like to commit it here, please do!


**Translations**

You are welcome to translate the posters. We want them to be available in as many languages as possible. We only ask you to make available publicly.

The posters use [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/). If you don't have it in your computer, you will need to:

1. Download [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/). There is a big "Download" button on the homepage
2. Uncompress the downloaded .zip file. Out comes a directory called <code>font-awesome-version_number</code>
3. Inside that directory, find the <code>fonts/fontawesome-webfont.ttf</code> file
4. Copy that file and paste it in your system's fonts directory

A suggested approach might be:

1. [clone the repository](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters)
2. translate them
3. Add 2 or 3 letter language code to the end of each poster - e.g. "screenreader_fr.pdf."
4. send a pull request so we can merge them, or tell us where they are so we can advertise them here.


**Licensing**

The posters are available under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license - this means you can reuse, adapt them for non-commercial uses as long as you attribute the original project.
