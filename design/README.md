## Design ethics
Our [design ethics toolkit] provides techniques and resources for our teams to help them consider the ethical consequences of their designs.

## Inclusive language
We have designed [inclusive language posters](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/design/Inclusive%20language) for the following protected characteristics:
* age
* disability
* ethnicity and nationality
* religion
* sexuality
* sex and gender
